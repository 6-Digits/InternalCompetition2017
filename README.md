# InternalCompetition2017
The program used to control a remote control robot for the Stony Brook University Robotics Team Internal Competition. This program is written in Arduino to be compaitible with an Arduino Servo Controller. The code was written specifically for specific wiring of inputs and in response to the remote controller being an Xbox 360 Controller. 

To run the code, it must be uploaded to an Arduino Servo Controller using the Arduino IDE and connecton wire. The proogram for running the Xbox 360 controller to move the robot is seperate from the Arduino File.
